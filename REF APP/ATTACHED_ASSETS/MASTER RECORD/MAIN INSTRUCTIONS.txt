AI Prompt for One-Click Report Generation Update
Objective
Update the existing application to streamline document generation by implementing a single-button interface for generating and downloading all required documents (Comparative, Scrutiny, Work Order, Acceptance) in a zipped report, addressing the issue of multiple buttons in the current interface.
Current Status
The application generates four documents (Comparative, Scrutiny, Work Order, Acceptance) but uses multiple buttons, leading to a complex user experience. A single-sheet code sample with placeholder text for each document is available. The app also has issues with unauthorized text in statutory formats and requires specific output formats and orientations.
Requirements
Enhance the application to:

Single-Button Interface:

Replace the existing multi-button interface with one button to trigger the generation and download of all documents.
The button should produce a zipped report containing all four documents in both .doc and .pdf formats.


Output Formats:

Generate all documents (Comparative, Scrutiny, Work Order, Acceptance) in .doc and .pdf formats.
Ensure all documents fit on a single A4-sized page.
Set the Comparative document to landscape orientation; others can remain in portrait unless specified.


Statutory Compliance:

Fix errors where unauthorized text is added to statutory departmental formats.
Ensure all documents strictly adhere to predefined templates without modifications.


Timestamps:

Do not add new timestamps to any documents or outputs to maintain consistency with existing formats.



Input Provided

A single-sheet code sample containing placeholder text for each document (Comparative, Scrutiny, Work Order, Acceptance) will be shared to reflect the current state.

Deliverables

Updated application code that:
Implements a single-button interface for generating and downloading a zipped report containing all documents in .doc and .pdf formats.
Ensures all documents fit on a single A4 page, with the Comparative document in landscape orientation.
Eliminates unauthorized text in statutory formats.
Avoids adding new timestamps.


Documentation or comments explaining the changes, particularly how the multi-button interface was consolidated into a single button.

Constraints

Maintain compatibility with the existing application architecture.
Ensure strict adherence to statutory formats.
Optimize for a seamless user experience with minimal interaction (one button).

Notes

Use the provided code sample as the baseline for updates.
Ensure the zipped report is generated efficiently and includes all required documents.
Test the output to confirm compliance with A4 sizing, orientation, and statutory formats.
Prioritize clean, maintainable code with clear comments for future reference.
